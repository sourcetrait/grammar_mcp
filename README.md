SourceTrait Grammar MCP
================================================================================
[![License Badge]][License] [![Rein Badge]][AI]

Harness MCP powered by Nushell.

Agent-maintained documentation is located in [./doc/ai/doc.yaml](doc/ai).

Skills are located in [./agent/skill](agent/skill).

Tested with:
- Claude Code
- ChatGPT Codex
- Mistral Vibe CLI (GLM)

Building
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`nu build.nu` builds the release, a signed OptZip in `target/pkg/` carrying the
MCP, nushell, their plugins, and the grammar and gram equips.

It requires gram's repository cloned beside this one, as `gram`: `ext/gram`
links to it, and the package carries its equip.
