# lib.rs

The MCP's side of its remote engines: a session with a worker over SSH, and
the system that holds one a host. It takes the protocol, russh, and
sourcetrait_common alone, never the engine, the operator, or the daemon, so a
product that drives a worker links it without an engine of its own.

## mod endpoint
A remote engine's entry, held to its rules once, at the config's load.

## mod session
The MCP's end of a session over any reader and writer, an SSH channel's or a
child's pipes, so the daemon's tests drive a real worker through the same
code the MCP does.

## mod ssh
The SSH connection a session rides, its exec channel, and the channel's
streams.

## mod system
The remote engines as a subsys system under the MCP's controller.

## deps
`bitcode`, `rkyv`, and `serde` are the cereal derive's own, every crate that
derives `Data` naming them.

## pub use
The endpoint and its defaults, the session, its events and an ask's
responder, the SSH open and its session, and the system with its messages,
parameters, paths, and handle.
