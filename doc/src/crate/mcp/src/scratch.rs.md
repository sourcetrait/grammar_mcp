# scratch.rs

A host's scratch directories, two a process, each private to it, made at its
start, and removed at its end: one for bulk, read by every definition as
`$env.EQUIP_TMP`, and one for small runtime files, `$env.EQUIP_TRANSIENT`. The
host makes them rather than reading directories from the environment, so it
works on any machine whatever its environment's conventions, and a path no
other process shares needs no id inside it to keep two hosts apart. The split
follows the XDG Base Directory spec, which keeps larger files out of
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, since it may sit in memory that cannot be swapped out.

Beside the transient one, each Channel open makes the Channel's inbox, a
directory of its own in the same base.

## const SCRATCH_PREFIX
The sweep's match: a directory not carrying it is never a scratch directory, so
the sweep cannot touch anything else in a shared base.

## const CHANNEL_PREFIX
Not the sweep's prefix: an inbox carries no owner marker and no sweep takes
it, its name the host's nom, which no other live host holds, or a random
suffix.

## static CHANNEL_DIRS
Every inbox the process made, not only the Channel's current one: a teardown
other than a deliberate close leaves its inbox for the agent to read, and the
next open makes another, so the end removes each.

## const SCRATCH_MODE
Asked of `tempfile` outright: its directories default to 0777 less the umask,
which left one 0755 under a 022 umask. The umask can only narrow the mode asked
for, never widen it.

## struct ScratchDirs
The bulk directory beside the transient one. Both always exist, so a definition
reads either without asking which the host could make.

## fn make_scratch_dirs
The bulk directory goes in the temporary directory, `UENV_USR_TMP`, `TMPDIR`,
or `/tmp`; the transient one in the runtime directory, `UENV_USR_TRANSIENT` or
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, or, where neither names one, beside the bulk one with a
warning, the fallback the XDG spec asks for. Both are read as every home is
(`home.rs`). Each base is swept first, so a host's start is what cleans after a
host killed outright, which runs no exit hook; a base the two share is swept
once. A base that does not exist fails the start: a platform's directory is
checked, never made.

A transient directory that cannot be made takes the bulk one with it, so a
failed start leaves neither.

Once a process: a second call returns the first directories, so a second start,
which the engine refuses, leaves none behind.

## fn tmp_dir / fn transient_dir
`None` before the start, which a caller reports as the host having no scratch
directory.

## fn make_channel_dir
The base is the transient directory's own, so an inbox follows the same order,
`UENV_USR_TRANSIENT`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, then beside the bulk one. The nom's
name is made with `create`, which fails on a name already there, so an inbox
left by an earlier open or a directory of anyone else's is never reused; the
fallback is `mkdtemp`'s, under the same prefix. Both are made at
`SCRATCH_MODE` from creation.

## fn remove_channel_dir
A deliberate close's and a failed start's removal, the path forgotten first: an
inbox the process removed is no longer its own, and a directory that takes its
name later is someone else's, which the end must leave.

## fn remove_scratch_dirs
Every ordinary end calls it, the client's, the test driver's, the one-shot's, a
failed start's, and a signal's (`run.rs`, `server/channel/face.rs`). The
inboxes go first, each one the process made; a directory already gone, an inbox
a deliberate close removed among them, is no error. A host killed outright
leaves its inbox, which nothing sweeps.

## fn make_dir
The shared guard's owned directory: the name unguessable and the mode 0700
from creation, so no other user can enter it and no other process can claim its
name first, and its owner marked with the guard's `owner.nuon`, which names the
boot and the PID namespace a sweep judges the owner under. Where this process's
start can't be read no marker is written, as on a platform with no process
table, and a sweep keeps the directory unmarked.

## fn sweep_stale
The shared guard's sweep (`sourcetrait_grammar_scratch`), the worker's own: a
directory goes only when the UID owns it and its marker's owner is proven gone,
and a process that can't be read is unknown, never dead. A directory without a
readable marker is kept: it may be a host's still between its creation and its
marker. Each directory kept with no running owner is reported on stderr.
