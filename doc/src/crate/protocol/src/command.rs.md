# command.rs

The `interface` tool's commands as data: one table the parse registers, the
description renders, and `--deny` names, so the three can never disagree. It
sits in the protocol crate so a frontend renders its tool description and parses
its deny set from the same catalog the runtime dispatches by, with no nushell in
it; the parse's decls are built from it where the parse runs. The commands
convert the tools that `execute`, `rerun`, and `call` left behind, each keeping
its tool's parameters and result as they were, `info` alone dropping its
purviews. The names are User's: `interface <topic> <action>`, or
`interface <action>` for `info` and `help`, with no underscore in any of them.

## const HELP_WORDS
`interface help interface` answers with the commands' signatures and `interface
help grimm` with grimm's: both words are reserved before any namepath is read.

## enum ArgShape
Three shapes cover every argument the commands take: a string, a list of
strings, and a whole number. Anything richer would be a value the agent could
build with an expression, and the contract takes literals alone.

## struct CommandSpec
`result` is the result's kind alone, `record`, `table`, or `nothing`, as the
description shows it (User): the commands answer what their tools answered,
built by the same serde structs, so the shape is the envelope's to carry and no
second copy of it is kept here.

`summary` is a summary's length, 80 characters at most (User), which a unit test
holds; User's own summaries stand where his draft has them.

### fn words
The deny name: what follows `interface `. A command is denied by the words an
agent types after the head, never by an invented key.

## const COMMANDS
Ordered as the description lists them, grouped by topic. A topic's commands sit
together because `render_signatures` opens a heading when the topic changes.
`channel sync`, and `channel open`'s `mode`, are User's additions beyond the
tools converted; `sync` sits after `open`, in the order of the handshake it
serves.

## fn render_command_list
The tool's description's list, User's format: `# Command Signatures`, a `##`
heading a topic, and a `- ` line a command, its words whole. The signatures
are `interface help interface`'s. `denied` takes a command's words, so the
caller's deny set stays its own.

## fn render_signatures
`interface help interface`'s block, and the grammar-mcp skill's last section,
which `tool_docs` holds to it. Generated from the same table the parse
registers, so the documentation can't drift from what parses, and a denied
command leaves both at once.

User's format: the note that each command begins with `interface `, then under
each topic's heading two lines a command, its summary and its signature in
backticks, with no bullet, no `def`, and the words after `interface` alone.
